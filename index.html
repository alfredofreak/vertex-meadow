<p>
Vertex Meadow is a tool that renders 2D images as 3D textured heightmaps.
With it you can create detailed and unusual 3D environments to explore
using a 2D paint-program-like interface.
</p>
<p>
The tool runs in a browser using webgl and you can share your creations
simply by sending a URL.
</p>
<p>
You can also chain together multiple levels by creating triggers
in your level that cause the player's browser to jump to a URL.
