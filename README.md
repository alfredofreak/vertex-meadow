## Vertex Meadow

Vertex Meadow is a tool that renders 2D images as 3D textured heightmaps.
With it you can create detailed and unusual 3D environments to explore
using a 2D paint-program-like interface.

You can use it by visiting http://www.vertexmeadow.xyz.

Vertex Meadow was made using [Amulet](https://github.com/ianmaclarty/amulet).
